                        ■ Space efficient for sparse graphs
                        ■ Time Complexity: O(1) for add edge, O(V+E) for traversal
             ■   Priority Queue
                     ■ For Dijkstra's algorithm in finding influential paths
                     ■ Time Complexity: O(log n) for insert and extract min
      ○ Algorithms:
             ■ Dijkstra's Algorithm
                     ■ To find shortest path from source to target
                     ■ Time Complexity: O(E log V) where E is the number of edges
                          and V is the number of vertices
             ■ Community Detection (Girvan-Newman)
                     ■ For identifying user communities
                     ■ Time Complexity: O(E log V) where E is the number of edges
                          and V is the number of vertices
